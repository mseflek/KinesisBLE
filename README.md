This repo is a personal fork of [This fantastic work to make a Bluetooth LE version of the Kinesis Advantage](https://github.com/sysdevmike/KinesisBLE). This will track the above as closely as possible. Main changes include:

- Restoring the default Kinesis layout in the master branch. Checkout my personal branch for my own take on the layout.
- Restore bluetooth connection reset keymap
    - Added disconnect key mapped to Keymap. It's not exactly needed that you clear the bonds. You can just turn the keyboard on and off and disconnect and it should be discoverable to a new machine. I will eventually implement a version where it clears all bonds with a key combo.
- TODO: Restore program key for power off keymap.

# Wireless Kinesis Advantage BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

Firmware for a custom controller to turn the [Kinesis Keyboard](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/) wireless. Written for the Adafruit nRF52 Feather Arduino board, which is built on Nordic's nRF52 SOC bluetooth module. 

**If you're brave enough to try this, read the [project](https://hackaday.io/project/161578-wireless-ble-kinesis-advantage-custom-controller) first!**

## Which Branch?

master

## Board Versions

V4 (SPI, current) - Single LED Power button (no RGB).

~~V3 (SPI) - This board still has RGB power led that shows yellow for charging / green when full. But using the Tx/Rx pins results in some buggy behavior for the LED(s).~~

~~V2 (i2c) - Swapped pins from TX/RX but we're still using i2c (MCP23017) chip which isn't that fast and limits the power savings of the board (runs at 5-7mA).~~

~~V1 (i2c) - Uses TX/RX and has high current leak.~~


## Many thanks to

- [Yin Zhong](https://summivox.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/keyboard-matrix-scanning-and-debouncing/) - Explains a better way to handle debouncing.
- [Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2018-04-17-kinx-keyboard-controller/) - Double mention as I adapted his debouncing implementation for his KinX controller on top of Matt's firmware.
- [Matt Vilim](https://github.com/mattvilim/FeatherCtrl) - New firmware is a ported version of his FeatherCtrl project providing significantly reduced latency.
- [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406) - Awesome documentation, libs and support on the forums.
- [afriggeri](https://github.com/afriggeri/kb) - This keyboard's firmware borrows heavily from his [Blanck Keyboard](https://medium.com/@friggeri/the-blanck-keyboard-24afe12e81a) firmware.
- [Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.de/posts/2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller/) - Michael Stapelberg's custom controller inspired this project. I also tried to route the board myself at first and ended up with a mess of probably over 50 vias. After imitating the routing between connectors, I ended up with less than 10 vias and a slicker board.
- [Humble Hacker](http://humblehacker.com/blog/20100720/hacking-the-kinesis-contoured-keyboard/) - Thankfully Kinesis hasn't made any changes to the key matrices (only connector types). So I was able to use the same matrix and connections as David did.
- [PCBgogo](http://www.pcbgogo.com) - Had some confusion with the design files and they helped clear it up. Delivery was also surprisingly fast.
